Derivative Shortcuts:
sin(x)' = cos(x)
cos(x)' = -sin(x)
tan(x)' = sec^2(x)
cot(x)' = -csc^2(x)
sec(x)' = sec(x)tan(x)
csc(x)' = -csc(x)cot(x)

Google Chrome Shortcuts(some of them):
Ctrl + n = open a new window
Ctrl + t = open new tab and jump to it
Alt + f then x = quit chrome
Ctrl + 9 = jump to the rightmost tab
Ctrl + tab = jump to next tab
Ctrl + shift + tab = jump to previous window

Indeterminate Form Shortcut:
According to L'Hospital's Rule, you can evaluate the limit of an indeterminate form by taking the derivative of f(x) divided by the derivative of g(x). For example:
The limit as x approaches 0 of sin(x)/x = sin(x)'/x' = 1

Log Function Shortcut:
(loga(x))' = 1/x * ln(a)
(ln(x))' = 1/x * ln(e)
