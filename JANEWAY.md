Four Reasons Voyager is not the worst.

They are the masters of the two-parter and had some great conceptual stories.
For instance, the episode where Chakotay has to fix the ship despite it being temporally incosistent. Details like Seska being on board during her attempted coup with the Kazons. They did a lot of cool Seka callbacks now that I think about it. A lot of their temporally themed stories were gold too, like the one where 7 has to visit the ship before she was a crew member. What about the dinosaur peopel who came from Earth? So many good stories.

The Doctor is a top 5 character for all series'.

Tuvix deserved to die.

7 of 9 is far more than eye candy.
Icheb is cool.
Hirogens look cool.
